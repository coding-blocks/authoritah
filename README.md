Authoritah is an unopinionated, tiny authorization library for node
applications. This is used internally at Coding Blocks for the authorization
subsystems of various applications, but is unopinionated enough to be useful in
any scenario where you need to enforce a set of rules on an object.

## Usage

Authoritah implements a rule based system, where a rule looks like this:

```javascript
{
  predicate: (x) => { ... },
  test: (x) => { ... }
}
```

Here, both `predicate()` and `test()` are **synchronous** functions returning
booleans. For each rule where the predicate returns `true` for the object under
scrutiny(supplied via `respect()`, see below), Authoritah ensures that the
corresponding `test()` returns a truthy value as well.

A sample rule used internally at Coding Blocks looks like this:

```javascript
const onlyAdminsCanDeleteRecords = {
  predicate: (request) => isDeleteRequest(request),
  test: (request) => currentUserIsAdmin(),
  httpErrorCode: 401,
  errorCode: 006
})
```

To add the rule:

```javascript
Authoritah.addRule(onlyAdminsCanDeleteRecords)
```

`addRule()` also returns a boolean value indicating whether your rule was added
or not.

Finally, ensure every rule passes against object `x` with:

```javascript
Authoritah.respect(x)
```

This returns a boolean indicating whether every rule passed or not.

To check the number of rules that have been added, use `Authoritah.ruleCount()`.

To clear all existing rules (useful for switching contexts), use
`Authoritah.clearRules()`.

## Example

```javascript
const Authoritah = require('cb-authoritah') ;

let manBearPig = {
  species: "ManBearPig",
  manFraction: 0.5,
  bearFraction: 0.5,
  pigFraction: 0.5
}

let fakeManBearPig = {
  species: "ManBearPig",
  manFraction: 0.1,
  bearFraction: 0.1,
  pigFraction: 0.8
}

let notManBearPig = {
  species: "NotManBearPig"
}

// Instantiate a context. You can do this multiple times to create different
// contexts for different uses.
const A = new Authoritah()

// Create a Rule for only creatures whose species is "ManBearPig", asserting
// that all such creatures should be half man, half bear, and half pig.
//
// - You can add as many rules as you like.
// - A rule will not be added if it lacks the required properties, ie, either a
//   predicate, a test, or both.
A.addRule({

  // This function is used to decide whether or not to test an object against
  // the rule. Use this to add rules for only certain kinds of objects. An
  // example would be to limit a userIsAdmin() test to only DELETE requests in a
  // web app.
  predicate: (creature) => {
    return (creature.species === "ManBearPig")
  },

  // This is the actual test. For all rules where the predicate returns 'true'
  // for the object under scrutiny, this function is used to figure out whether
  // the object is valid or not.
  test: (creature) => {
    return (
      (creature.manFraction === 0.5) &&
      (creature.bearFraction === 0.5) &&
      (creature.pigFraction === 0.5)
    )
  },

  // You can attach extra payload to your objects, with things like error codes
  // and messages, etc. Just be sure to quack like a duck.
  errorMessage: "That's no ManBearPig!"
})

// Test various objects against the registered rules. This only returns true if
// ALL rules attached to an object pass.
A.respect(manBearPig) // => true
A.respect(fakeManBearPig) // => false
A.respect(notManBearPig) // => true, because the rule is only for ManBearPigs

// A much more useful method is disrespectedRules(), which returns a list of all
// rules that were violated. Sorry about the naming, but the south park
// references are more important than code comprehension.
A.disrespectedRules(manBearPig) // => []
A.disrespectedRules(fakeManBearPig) // => [{ ... }]

A
  .disrespectedRules(fakeManBearPig)[0]
  .errorMessage // => "That's no ManBearPig!"

A.disrespectedRules(notManBearPig) // => []

// Get the number of registered rules.
A.ruleCount() // => 1

// Clear all rules, and return the cleared ones
A.clearRules() // => [{ ... }, ...]
A.ruleCount() // => 0
```
